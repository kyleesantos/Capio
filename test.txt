00:00:00.51	you don't have any children yet
00:00:07.59	well i have three children and i've used various different kinds of day care over the years um i think actually the hardest time
00:00:18.23	to find good day care is when you're babies very young
00:00:22.85	um because they can't tell you what's going on the worst experience i had was when i was working when my uh oldest child was a baby and i thought and i just i used a lady next door to me and you know was close by and it was convenient and he always came home clean and what have you but i discovered that her way of handling conflicts between little kids once they started crawling and stuff with very different from what i wanted for my son she always interfered and i understand that when you have a um
00:01:00.02	you know when you have a bunch of kids and you have to make sure that they're all taken care of and everything else you can't let
00:01:05.63	things escalate but she would deprive the environment in order for the kids not to fight and then just stick them in front of the t._v.
00:01:14.56	and i i you know and i didn't discover that until later on and for some i decided to quit working anyway but i decided that actually the the hardest time to find good is up to eighteen months old maybe from six weeks to six months you can do but once your baby starts crawling and stuff from them until they really start talking it's i i find that's the hardest time to find
00:01:37.34	really conference right now they're seven five and three
00:01:41.28	yeah so but then once they're eighteen mythology can often find good preschool kinds of situations but i think it's real important to check
00:01:52.40	how you want social interactions handle and how the school or day care does it
00:01:59.61	you know the other things to check they always tell you you know check to make sure that there's continuity of care that your child is gonna have somebody that they can make an attachment to and stick with
00:02:14.77	well i use something sort of like a daycare center um for my youngest one when i went back to school last year
00:02:23.50	and it was something that was partially funded by the school and it was data y._w._c._a.
00:02:30.57	and that was pretty good the biggest problem i had they're actually was that they
00:02:36.82	they tried to provide continuity of care but they kept changing the number of people that were in the program you know people drop out of school and so the kids would drop out of the program and the sentence and so and somebody would get sick and they'd start shifting people around from one room to the next and um
00:02:55.23	that was really tough on my son because he'd made a real strong attachment with one particular caregiver and then that one got switched out of his room but he he adjusted to it pretty well but that that was tough on him and they they did their best not to do that it's just that you know they kept having um
00:03:20.04	because they were using students to provide the care and because of the population of people who were using the care that became um much more of an issue with uh
00:03:32.15	yeah
00:03:36.37	well
00:03:38.46	in other words they should have the same person taking care of them
00:03:42.41	okay so the the same space the same and see different people even if a daycare center or a home or a school or something has a philosophy as to how to deal with certain kinds of situations not every individual applies that philosophy in the same way
00:04:02.97	and so it's nice for kids to have
00:04:07.11	a chance to get used to how things are going to happen so that they n- they have a chance they can start learning to predict a little bit i know real little ones don't do very much predicting but they should have a chance to say i yes okay i'm going to get there and this is going to happen and this is going to happen and if i do this
00:04:26.74	and that's going to happen you know they should have a way to be able to predict what's going to happen to them and um if you keep changing the people were there then they have nothing to hold onto and it's hard enough on little ones to be away from
00:04:43.08	the parents
00:04:44.81	uh yeah and then different children
